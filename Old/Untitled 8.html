    historicalNote: "The concept of 'vittoria mutilata' (mutilated victory) became a powerful political narrative in post-war Italy. Despite gaining approximately 9,000 square miles of territory and 1 million citizens, the gap between wartime promises and peace settlement results created lasting resentment. Poet Gabriele D'Annunzio's seizure of Fiume (not awarded to Italy) in 1919 exemplified this nationalist reaction, which Benito Mussolini would later harness in his rise to power."

                text: "You launch a diplomatic initiative focused on the principle of 'freedom of the seas,' challenging the legality of Britain's distant blockade. This approach resonates with neutral maritime nations, particularly the United States, where President Wilson has long advocated similar principles. Through neutral intermediaries, you propose naval limitations that would restrict both submarine warfare and blockade measures. While Britain resists, the initiative improves Germany's diplomatic position and complicates Anglo-American relations.",

President Wilson included it as the second of his Fourteen Points, though the principle was never clearly defined. Britain's distant blockade did stretch international law, while German submarine warfare violated traditional rules requiring warning before sinking merchant vessels. American and British interpretations of maritime rights remained a source of friction even after the U.S. entered the war."

Through secret diplomatic channels, a framework understanding emerges: Germany would restrict submarine warfare, while Wilson would pressure Britain to modify its blockade practices.
